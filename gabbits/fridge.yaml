# To look at resource providers from another angle, this YAML file
# describes a single resource provider, a fridge, containing lots of
# different classes of inventory (which we must create), and various
# consumers making meals from it.
#
# The goal here is to try to make it clear that the data model is
# generic and many things can be tracked.
#
# We're going to model everything here using one flat resource provider.
# It would also be possible to model things are nested providers where
# every container in the fridge (such as a pickle jar) is a provider
# with its own inventory. This would be useful if there were different
# types of pickles (dill or sweet for example) in the fridge. We'll do
# that in a future example.
#
# For now we are simply tracking all the stuff in the fridge, none of
# which has any traits. The pickles may be in different jars but it
# doesn't matter: It only matters how many total pickles there are.
#
# Remember: if you run these interactions with 'verbose: True' or
# '-v all' on the gabbi-run command you can see the full requests.

# Now we need to create a series of custom resource classes. The built

# relatively rare.

# A custom resource class is upper case ASCII and numerals and has a
# CUSTOM_ prefix. They often (but not always) include a unit.
