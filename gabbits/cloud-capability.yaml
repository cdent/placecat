# We have four different clouds, each one named by a URL.
# Each cloud has a set of capabilities that advertise what it can do.
# These capabilities are totally made up for the sake of this exercise.

tests:

    # Create the traits that represent the capabilities.
    # loops or bulking would be nice here
